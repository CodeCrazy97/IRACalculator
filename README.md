# IRACalculator
This IRA calculator will calculate overall investment returns.

It considers factors such as your age, the age you plan to retire, the amount you will invest, how many years you will invest, the beginning balance of your IRA, ROI, and inflation rate. The calculator will show year by year IRA balance.

The "More" button on the calculator will allow you to specify how much you'll contribute during different spans of your life (up to three different spans). For example: you could specify that you will contribute $2,000 per year when you are between 24 and 31, $3,000 per year when you are between 31 and 50, and $500 per year when you are between 55 and 60. If you don't wish to use all three spans, then simply leave one of the age drop-downs for the unused age span as "Not used".
